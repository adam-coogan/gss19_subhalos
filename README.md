# GRAPPA Student Seminar 2019: subhalos group

## Topic

Structures like the Milky Way halo are made of smaller substructures. How much do we know the properties of these subhalos, both observationally and theoretically? Presence of subhalos is particularly important for indirect dark matter searches through, e.g., gamma rays. What is the current status of this line of research?
